While it is true that different colors or clarities may have different prices, upon closer examination those variations in price seem to be linked to `carat` (weight) and its `dimensions`. In our analysis, the key factor to determining a diamond's value was placed solely in the aforementioned features, since we can see in our correlation coefficients and in the coefficient of determination that these features are closely related."
